This project is an implementation of an AI chess game using Python. It utilizes the Minimax algorithm and Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) to make intelligent move decisions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Any IDE (preferably PyCharm)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/ssanjan123/AI-Chess--In-progress-/tree/main

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the main script to start the game.

## Features

- Implements the Minimax algorithm for intelligent move decisions.
- Uses CSP for move constraints and board evaluation.
- User friendly GUI for playing the game.

## Built With

- Python 3.x
- PyCharm
